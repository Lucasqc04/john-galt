This way, the government has access to all information about your transaction, including where your Bitcoin is and who owns it.",

In addition to the fixed withdrawal fee, your transactions are exposed to government control. And the price of this exposure can be high: taxes of up to 27.5% may apply, depending on your location and prevailing regulations.",
